Summary: How i organize my bill pay

Our memory is not a computer timed task which executes a precise task at precise time. Even if we are good at remembering things
we will forget things if our mind is busy with some other important task. So if we have to
accomplish timely bill pay we need to take help of technology to its fullest. Thus freeing our mind for things which
are important to be accomplished. My rules for this are

1. Use auto bill pay where the amount is fixed
   If we are paying fixed amount then there is no need to monitor it for any fluctuations. For me, some of such bills are
   1. Rent
   2. Internet Bills (I have taken unlimited internet)
   3. Mobile Bills (I have taken prepaid)
   4. Cloud storage

    If possible, setup SMS alerts for Internet and Mobile bills, if they are post paid. This will help you to monitor your bills in case it overshoots
    your budget.

2. Setup SMS Alerts for fluctuating bills
   Pay the bill the moment you get the notification. If you stick to this then you will not miss any bill pay. I am reluctant
   to setup auto bill pay for such bills as i need to know what my bill is before paying, there could a possible billing error
   and we never come to notice it if we setup auto bill pay.


By sticking to these two rules, i have eased my mind from thinking about this mundane task and i have never missed a payment too.
