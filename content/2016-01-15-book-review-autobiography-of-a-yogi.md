Summary: Review of the book autobiography of a yogi

   This is a spiritual book. For an atheist or to someone who questions some of the theist thinking
   this is definite no no. This book can only be appreciated by
   1. Who is highly spiritual
   2. Who can appreciate an underlying message

   In this book the author Paramahansa Yogananda, describes his life journey. I personally felt that
   the author to get his message into the reader has used euphoric exaggerated miracles performed
   by his teachers as a tool. These miracles are felt by the author's mental self might not be
   actual physical experiences. But surprisingly though the content penetrates through your
   scientific mind and a kind of calmness is felt while reading this book. This book also gives
   us a glimpse of earlier 20th century india and US. But it gets a bit boring as the author
   bombards you with miracles page after page.

   My take away from this book is "Mind" is an important organ which has to be kept in harmony. If
   that can be achieved then body will be in harmony and healthy. The suggested way in this book
   is by kriya yoga. It is a form of meditation. Once i have got this message then i did not
   feel the need of reading through the pages of miracle performed by yogis.

   One can give it a try to read this but this book might not appeal to many. And also this book is
   quite long and to have sustained will power to finish the book, overcoming the boredom is challenging.
