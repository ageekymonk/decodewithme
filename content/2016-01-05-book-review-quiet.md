Summary: Review of the book quiet by susan cain

   This introvert centered book by Susan Cain explores the world of introverts.
   This book helped me understand about myself a lot. Some of my quirks started to make
   sense and was a bit comfortable to know many of my fellow introverts have similar quirks.
   The book covered lot of ground about introverts like

   1. Who are introverts and some of famous introverts
   2. Quirks of introverts
   3. How the world treats an introverts and rise of extrovert centric world?
   4. Why did evolution spared the introverts ?
   5. Genetic connection to introvert nature
   6. Physiological differences of an introvert
   7. How Risk handling differs between introverts and extroverts
   8. Eastern culture and their emphasis on being an introvert
   9. Work place problems for an introvert and how to handle it
   10. Getting best out of being introvert and what to learn from extroverts
   11. Pseudo introverts and how they do it
   12. Introvert Extrovert couples
   13. Introvert kid. How to handle him/her?

   This is a good read not only for introverts but also for extroverts. Though extroverts might
   feel that their role is being downplayed a bit. I am not sure how the author could have avoided it.
   It was good to know that many like me have the same feelings. Overall it is a very informative and
   could be a self realizing one for introverts. For an extrovert, especially the one who is in
   relation with an introvert will know how to appreciate and handle an introvert. Overall it is a must
   read for an introvert and also to an extrovert who is living with an introvert (kid, spouse, friend)
