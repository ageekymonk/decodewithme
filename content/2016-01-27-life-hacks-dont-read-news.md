Summary: IMHO, you should not read news

I used to be a news buff. I want to keep myself updated with current affairs. One of my daily routine
after i wake up is to read news paper. I also read news whenever i get time. It took something between an hour to 2 hours
per day for this.

Recently i was very busy with multitude of things and did not get time to read news. In retrospect i noticed few things
1. I had more time
   Not spending those two hours on reading news meant more time for me to do things that matter to me and my family
2. I was oblivious to the evil around the world
   World news is full of evil men and women doing bad things to people. Thinking or reading such news
   left a bad taste. Not knowing such evil kept me happy.
3. I still knew the news
   If there are important news people talk about them in the office water coolers and so i eventually came to know
   about it.

If you do not read news you will come to know about things little late and you might look stupid among your friends
and colleagues. But does it matter ? My answer was no. So i continued not reading news.
